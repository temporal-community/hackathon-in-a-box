Here are some notes / best practices on leading Temporal Hackathons such as the [Replay 2025 Hackathon](https://temporal.io/blog/replay-25-day-one-hackathon-workshops). This ["unconference"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) format can be adapted for big groups, small groups, internal hackathons, and public hackathons. It emphasizes _collaboration_ over competition, and encourages participants to leave the event having made real connections with like-minded peers.

This format was _heavily_ inspired by [DrupalCon](https://events.drupal.org/) Contribution Sprints. ðŸ’—

# What you will need

## Room setup
* Several tables (6-8 person rounds work well, with a couple of smaller ones for smaller groups)
* Placards (each table needs a label; you can make these "fun" like naming after tech terminology or sci-fi characters)
* Whiteboard (for holding the "map" of which tables are working on what)
* A/V (for orientation / demos)
  * Note: Everyone's going to be demoing from their own laptops, so you need an A/V setup that allows for rapid-fire HDMI switching.

## People
* **Host / Facilitator**
  * (optional, but helpful) Co-Facilitator ("Vanna White" role :) to handle voting and clustering while the host is hosting)
* **Floaters**, who can help with technical questions and get people unstuck
  * At least a couple of these should also be prepared to act as **Table Runners** who can pitch ideas / offer to host tables if participants are shy

Recommend no less than a 1:10 ratio of Floaters to Participants.

# Suggested agenda
(This assumes a 9 - 5 day; adjust schedule accordingly.)

| Time | Phase | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| 9:00 - 9:30 | Registration / Networking | Allow folks to get settled in and mingle |
| 9:30 - 9:45 | Orientation | Give an overview of the day, set expectations |
| 9:45 - 10:00 | Pitches | Ask folks to stand up and pitch an idea of what they want to work on for the day |
| 10:00 - 10:15 | Voting / Clustering | Figure out which topics have the most interest and/or "cluster" like topics together; assign these to tables in the room |
| 10:15 - 17:45 | Hack Time | Participants distribute themselves to tables of interest, hacking begins! (Don't forget to eat lunch!) |
| 17:45 - 16:00 | PENCILS DOWN / BREAK | Allow folks to sign up to give demos |
| 16:00 - 17:00 | Demos | Participants show off what they built during the day in 5-minute lightning talks |

# Lessons learned the hard way ;)

## A/V
* Beware of Hz differences between North America and Europe.

## MORE TO COME ;)
